# envisaclient
Envisalink client application for NodeJS.

This project is my personal attempt to create an application that talks to my envisalink.  I wanted to write in for NodeJS since it's so easily adaptable to multiple systems, like my Synology NAS.

This is my first GitHub project, and I'm still learning how it all works.  The reason I am using it is because I'm a noob at Node, and at javascript.  So by making it public, I'm welcoming input from more experianced programmers.  

I'm getting a lot of my inspiration from this https://github.com/MattTW/HoneyAlarmServer, which is essentially the same concept but written in python.
